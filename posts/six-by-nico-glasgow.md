A Story Every Six Weeks. Fine Dining tasting menu that can be paired with wine tasting.
Not for kids I hear you cry! But wait, I took my three year old, not too eat but to come to the restaurant.
There were no unhappy faces from those seated nearby, the staff where great and she had a great time.
So fam friendly for sure just dont expect them to eat!
