FamJam is a list of independent, family-friendly eateries, organised by city.

It was created by [Laurence Hughes](https://fuzzylogic.me), a Glaswegian web developer, just as a fun-side project just to try out some new technology.

If you’re up for it, you can [add a new café or restaurant recommendation on Github](https://github.com/fuzzylogicxx/sofrito).
